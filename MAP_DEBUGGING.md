# Map Loading Debug Guide

## Issue Fixed
The "Cargando Mapa" (Loading Map) state was getting stuck when clicking location links. This has been fixed with the following improvements:

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the map initialization process
- Added fallback mechanisms to prevent infinite loading states
- Improved error messages to help identify specific issues

### 2. Fixed Google Maps API Loading
- Added proper error handling for API loading failures
- Added fallback API key handling (uses 'DEMO_KEY' if not configured)
- Improved script loading detection and callback handling

### 3. Fixed Map Initialization
- Added fallback from AdvancedMarkerElement to regular Marker if not available
- Fixed event listener handling to prevent TypeScript errors
- Added proper cleanup of event listeners
- Ensured `mapLoaded` state is always set to prevent infinite loading

### 4. Added Debug Logging
The following debug messages are now logged to the browser console:
- `[DEBUG] loadGoogleMapsAPI called`
- `[DEBUG] Google Maps API loaded, initializing map...`
- `[DEBUG] Container found, starting map initialization process...`
- `[DEBUG] Container not ready, retrying in 100ms... (X/50)`
- `[DEBUG] Map instance created successfully`
- `[DEBUG] Map is idle, creating marker...`
- `[DEBUG] Map loaded successfully`
- `[DEBUG] Container became available, retrying map initialization...`

## Environment Setup

To ensure the map works properly, create a `.env.local` file in the project root with:

```env
# Google Maps API Key (required for map functionality)
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-google-maps-api-key-here
```

## Testing the Fix

1. Open the browser developer console (F12)
2. Click on a location link
3. Watch the console for debug messages
4. The map should now load properly instead of getting stuck on "Cargando Mapa"

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Google Maps API not fully loaded"
**Solution**: Check that `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is set in your environment variables

### Issue: "No container found for map"
**Solution**: The code now automatically retries waiting for the container to become available (up to 5 seconds). This handles React timing issues where the useEffect runs before the DOM element is mounted.

### Issue: "AdvancedMarkerElement not available"
**Solution**: The code will automatically fallback to regular Google Maps Marker

### Issue: Map loads but no marker appears
**Solution**: Check the console for marker creation errors - the map will still load but without a draggable marker

## Debug Information

The enhanced logging will help identify exactly where the map loading process fails:
- API loading issues
- Map initialization problems
- Marker creation failures
- Event listener problems

All errors are now properly caught and the `mapLoaded` state is set to prevent infinite loading states.
